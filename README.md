# random-unicode-emoji

A small, simple lib that returns random unicode emojis. 

Only 4kb and has no dependencies 👼

## Install ✨

## Usage 🐙

```
var randomEmoji = require('random-unicode-emoji');

randomEmoji.random({count: 3})
// -> ["🐸", "🍇", "🚣"]

```

## Looking for a New Owner

I'm [pretty busy](https://kinopio.club) these days and don't have time to keep this repo up to date with the latest emojis. It's small and simple, and a couple people use it. If you'd like to contribute or take over this project please hit me up!
